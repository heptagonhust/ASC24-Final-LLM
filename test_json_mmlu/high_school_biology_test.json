This is an example of\n\nChoices:\nA: directional selection.\nB: stabilizing selection.\nC: sexual selection.\nD: disruptive selection.\n\nAnswer: A\n\n\nQuestion:\nWhich of the changes below following the start codon in an mRNA would most likely have the greatest deleterious effect?\n\nChoices:\nA: a deletion of a single nucleotide\nB: a deletion of a nucleotide triplet\nC: a single nucleotide substitution of the nucleotide occupying the first codon position\nD: a single nucleotide substitution of the nucleotide occupying the third codon position\n\nAnswer: A\n\n\nQuestion:\nThe energy given up by electrons as they move through the electron transport chain is used to\n\nChoices:\nA: break down glucose\nB: make glucose\nC: produce ATP\nD: make NADH\n\nAnswer: C\n\n\nQuestion:\nThe primary site of glucose reabsorption is the\n\nChoices:\nA: glomerulus\nB: proximal convoluted tubule\nC: loop of Henle\nD: collecting duct\n\nAnswer: ",
